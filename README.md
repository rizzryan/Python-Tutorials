# Hello World!

## Welcome
You are most likely here for one reason, to learn the wonderful language of Python!

## What will you learn?
Here, you will learn the basics of Python. I will throw in some challenges here and there so that you can challenge yourself. As you master these challenges, I will cover more difficult concepts in Python. I am always available for help, so do not worry if you get stuck.

## Why am I teaching this?
I simply just want to help others learn what I have learned so far.

## What do you need?
* A computer of course
* Python installed (either Python 2 or Python 3. I will cover the differences in both versions)
* Terminal/Command line
* Patience

## The basics
To run a Python script is very simple, once you get the hang of it.

### How will you know the script is a Python script?
Python scripts end in a ```.py``` format. For example, ```hello_world.py``` is a python script due to the ```.py``` ending.

### How do you run a Python script?
1. Open up Terminal/Command line
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located
	1. ```cd Desktop/example```
3. Verify that the script is there
	1. ```ls```
		* The ```ls``` command simply lists what is in the current directory.
4. Type ```python FILENAME.py``` where FILENAME is the name of the saved file.
